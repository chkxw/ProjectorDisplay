# Projector Display Calibration File
# ===================================
#
# This file defines the mapping between world coordinates (meters)
# and screen coordinates (pixels).
#
# REQUIRED: The server will not start without a valid calibration file.
#
# Vertex Order Convention: [BL, BR, TR, TL] (counter-clockwise from bottom-left)
# - BL = Bottom-Left
# - BR = Bottom-Right
# - TR = Top-Right
# - TL = Top-Left

# Resolution of the display when this calibration was created
# If current resolution doesn't match, server will reject the calibration
resolution:
  width: 1920
  height: 1080

# Screen field mapping
screen_field:
  # World coordinates of the projected area corners (in meters)
  # These are the physical positions in your lab/experiment space
  world_points:
    - [0.0, 0.0]    # BL - bottom-left corner in meters
    - [4.0, 0.0]    # BR - bottom-right corner in meters
    - [4.0, 3.0]    # TR - top-right corner in meters
    - [0.0, 3.0]    # TL - top-left corner in meters

  # Screen coordinates of the projected area corners (in pixels)
  # Note: In pygame, Y=0 is at the TOP of the screen
  local_points:
    - [0, 1080]     # BL - bottom-left of screen
    - [1920, 1080]  # BR - bottom-right of screen
    - [1920, 0]     # TR - top-right of screen
    - [0, 0]        # TL - top-left of screen

# When this calibration was created (informational)
